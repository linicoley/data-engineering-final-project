CMSC 13600 Final Project

## Motivation: NYC Taxi Data
Taxis are widely used in New York City and the recorded information of where and when taxi cabs are requested can be valuable to understand traffic flow and movement patterns in the city. The data used in the attached datasets were collected and provided to the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC). The For-Hire Vehicle (“FHV”) trip records include fields capturing the dispatching base license number and the pick-up date, time, and taxi zone location ID (shape file below). These records are generated from the FHV Trip Record submissions made by bases. 

In particular, we will study how the COVID-19 pandemic affected taxi ridership as well as pickup-dropoff location patterns in NYC. We can think of March 2020 to be a sort of natural experiment to understand how increased remote working would change city traffic patterns. The key challenge is that the data that we consider is highly seasonal. Seasonality is a characteristic of a time series in which the data experiences regular and predictable changes that recur every calendar year, as a result we will have to tease out the differences between changes due to seasonality versus changes due to COVID-19.
